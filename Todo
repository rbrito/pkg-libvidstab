Some things that could be done

- optimal zoom detection with sliding average
- transform calculation in motiondetect with full matrix estimation (pseudoinverse)

- make transform stage work with fifo file for transforms, such that streaming is also possible with 2-stage version.

- write full motion detection to file and delegate final transformation detection to snd-phase
